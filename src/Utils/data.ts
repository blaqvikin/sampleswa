    question: "What is a capability statement and do you really need it?",
    answer: `It's
      a short summary (typically 1-page long) that outlines your
      business competencies (akin to a resume) and yes, you need it.
      Ideally it provides your capabilities and is also an opportunity
      to tell your stakeholders your value proposition. The process of
      creating our own statement was both expensive and time consuming.
      True to our mission, we had an idea! Why not create a tool to save
      you from having to go through the same experience. We created a
      web application that enables you to use these templates to print
      your own capability statement for free! Add your companyâ€™s logo,
      fill out a few form fields and certifications and you're done.
      Save your template as either a PDF, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, send
      to your email, or print.`,
